# iEarthDModel
I will try to build a multi-parameter global earth model using the datasets in iEarthDataset.

This project will be divided into the following two steps:

Step 1: Develop a modeling algorithm to build a global multiparameter model.

Step 2: Develop a model display tool based on Qt+Python.
